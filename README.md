# Parking Lot API

## Overview

Welcome to the **Parking Lot API**! This project is the backend for the Parking Lot Management System, built using **Spring Boot**. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing parking lots, reservations, and user accounts. This project handles the business logic, data persistence, and integration with the frontend application ([parking-lot-ui](https://github.com/dustngroh/parking-lot-ui)).

The system allows users to register, log in, and manage parking lot reservations, while administrators can oversee parking lot operations.
